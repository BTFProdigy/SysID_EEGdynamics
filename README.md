## Quick Start
### 1. Clone this repository
### 2. Run Classification Model of interest

## Full Pipeline
### 1. Download Data
- DEAP data: The DEAP data set is publicly available, but requires access request [here](http://anaxagoras.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/request.php?dataset=DEAP). It should be placed in the src/data folder
- EEGMMI data: Download the EEGMMI data set into the src/data folder of this repository using: ```wget -r -N -c -np https://physionet.org/files/eegmmidb/1.0.0/``` 
- Alternatively, this repository contains the processed data by default. You can skip generating features and just run the subject classification model.
### 2. Create environment
- Open a terminal to the root of this repository, where ```environment.yml``` is located. 

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

```conda activate eegID```

### 3. Generate Features
- Select Matlab script in ```src/features``` for data and algortithm of interest 
 - ```src/features/DMDheatmaps.m``` generates the heatmaps and tabular input data for the DEAP dataset with the DMD algorithm
 - ```src/features/DMDheatmaps_Physio.m``` generates the heatmaps and tabular input data for the EEGMMI dataset with the DMD algorithm
 - ```src/features/OMAheatmaps.m``` generates the heatmaps and tabular input data for the DEAP dataset with the OMA algorithm
 - ```src/features/DMDheatmaps_Physio.m``` generates the heatmaps and tabular input data for the EEGMMI dataset with the OMA algorithm
- Modify heatmap and tabular output paths according to your needs 

### 4. Run Classification Model
- Select the relevant Jupyter notebook for the generated features
- Modity the path variable to target your features instead of the preprocessed data
- Run the notebook
